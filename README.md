# Bamazon Department Store App

### Description 

This is an interactive command line department store app with two sections. 

### How it Works
The Customer View allows the user to see a list of products and their prices, select a product and make a purchase. The Manager View gives the user a menu of managerial options such as viewing items with low inventory, restocking those items, as well as an option to add new products to sell.
